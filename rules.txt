RULES:

The player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts. Its position is given by the letter 'H'.

There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player. If the player touches the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and the player!).

The robots, represented as 'R' are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.

Every time the player moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a contiguous cell, each robot moves one cell closer to the new player's location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow the player!

The path to victory is simple: make the robots hit the maze or each other. When a robot dies its symbol changes to 'r'. If all of them are destroyed, the player wins.


GAMEPLAY:

The player can only move to one of the 8 neighbour cells of their current cell. They are not allowed to move to cells that are occupied by robots.

The movement is indicated by typing one of the letters indicated below (the position of each letter relatively to the player's position indicates the movement that the player wants to do):

 _____________________

If you wish to remain in your position type 'S'.

You can exit the game anytime by clicking CTRL-Z.


Good Luck! :D
